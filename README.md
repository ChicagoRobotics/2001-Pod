# 2001-Pod
Hello, this project is intended to PRIVATELY share files for the 3D printing of the EVA POD from the movie 2001.

Please do not share these files with anyone.  I would gladly publish the files publicly, but I have two concerns; I might want to charge for them in some way, and there might be copyright issues.

Please feel free to create issues related to printing the parts, and thanks for your interest.

Suggested prints:

Print in Silver: "Arm Shaft", "Headlight"
Print in Black: "Window", "Thruster", "Bells"
Print in White: EVERYTHING ELSE
